# Introduction

This guide will help you get up and running with the badge and fittingly help introduce you to other attendees.

## Running

## On the simulator

The simulator is ideal for fast iteration as it supports live reloading.

Run `zig build watch` and head to https://badgesim.microzig.tech/.

## On hardware

Once you're happy with what you've made, you'll need to flash it onto your badge!
