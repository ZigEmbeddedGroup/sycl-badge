//! This demo validates the finalized PCBs.
//!
//! The bootloader demonstrates correct behavior of:
//!
//! - LCD
//! - USB
//! - Neopixels
//!
//! This program will demonstrate correct behavior of:
//!
//! - Buttons
//! - Light Sensor
//! - Speaker
//! - QSPI Flash
//!
//! The program will copy a function into RAM, then call into it from there.
//! This function will take the user through steps to test the different
//! subsystem. The last step will load an image from QSPI flash and display it
//! on the LCD. Once that is done, the function will erase both the QSPI flash
//! and program flash, effectively resetting the device. It will then reboot,
//! and the user should be greeted by the bootloader.
//!
//! In addition to this test, the bootloader should be given an image which
//! attempts to write over it's own address space, and it should be denied.
